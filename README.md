# Skills for Machine Learning Repository

The purpose of this repo is to create 'skills' for agents that are optimised for Machine Learning using Python.

Inspired by an example to [log succesful and failed Machine Learning experiments in templates that are reusable as agent's skills](https://huggingface.co/blog/sionic-ai/claude-code-skills-training).
